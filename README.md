# Uno.js Mono Repo
A JS library that exports one function per file, which doesn't even need to be downloaded.

This library exports one function per file, which means that you can import only the functions you need, and not the whole library. This is useful for reducing the size of your bundle, and for making your code more readable.

The documentation for it is built from the source code, so you can always be sure that it's up to date, via the `genDocs` directory.

**Note:** This is a mono repo for the Uno.js library. If you want documentation for a specific function, you can head over to the [Documentation](https://github.com/theatom06/uno.js/blob/main/documentation/README.md).

This repo has four main directories:

- `docs`: Contains the under construction documentation website for the library.
- `documentation`: Contains the documentation for the library.
- `genDocs`: Contains the docuemntation generator for the library.
- `lib`: Contains the source code for the library.

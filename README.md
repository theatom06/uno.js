Uno.js is a JavaScript library that offers the convenience of exporting one function per file without the need for downloading the entire library.

By exporting individual functions, Uno.js allows you to import only the specific functions you require, resulting in a smaller bundle size and improved code readability.

The documentation for Uno.js is automatically generated from the source code, ensuring that it is always up to date. You can find the documentation in the `genDocs` directory.

Please note that this repository serves as a mono repo for the Uno.js library. If you need documentation for a particular function, you can visit the [Documentation](https://github.com/theatom06/uno.js/blob/main/documentation/README.md) section.

The repository consists of five main directories:

- `documentation`: Contains the comprehensive library documentation.
- `lib`: Contains the library's source code.
- `genDocs`: Houses the documentation and website generator for the library.
- `docs`: Contains the documentation website.
- `website-dev`: Contains the source code for the website
